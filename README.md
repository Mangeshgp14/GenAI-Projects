# GenAI Projects 🚀🤖

A product-first collection of my hands-on generative AI work — built and documented from a product manager's perspective.  
This repo showcases end-to-end GenAI product thinking: problem framing, hypotheses, experiments, MVPs, success metrics, tradeoffs, and outcomes.

# Heyy 👋
I’m a product manager building Gen-AI Products.
I am building expertise in the GenAI domain by shipping: building full projects that span **user problem → data → model & prompts → UX → metrics → iteration**. This repo is my public notebook of that work — resume-ready and decision-focused.
