# Text2Query 🔍➡️🧾

**Summary:** Help non-technical Product Managers turn plain-English questions into SQL queries and actionable answers — so PMs can validate hypotheses and track KPIs without waiting on data teams.

---

## Context
Product Managers use SQL every day to:
1. Track KPIs  
2. Validate hypotheses from experiments or user research  
3. Extract and analyze data for product decisions  

Many PMs are comfortable with analytics thinking but not with SQL syntax. That gap creates delays and context loss when relying on others.

---

## Problem Statement ❗
Non-technical PMs spend hours writing and debugging SQL or waiting for data teams to deliver extracts. This slows decision cycles and reduces the number of rapid experiments a PM can run.

---

## Solution ✨
A product that connects to the databases and enables PMs to query them by asking questions in natural language and get:
- a ready-to-run SQL query, and
- a short plain-English explanation of the result and next steps.
